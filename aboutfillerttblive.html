            <div id="firstpara"> At TechTogether Boston, we're looking to shape the way <span style="color:#FA7166">women and non-binary people </span> get involved with tech.</div>

            <div> We aim to create an inclusive environemnt to encourage more underrepresented people to either get introduced to the world of technology or harness their skills to create projects of their own.</div>
            <div> With the support of the technology community, industry, and individuals, we can chip away at the gender gap and empower anayone from someone with a non-technical major with an interest in tech, to seasoned hackathon veterans looking to build out a complicated and groundbreaking product with a little extra support.</div>
